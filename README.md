FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
1. How can I switch between light and dark theme?
The theme can be changed at any time by clicking the "Light/Dark Theme" button in the top-right corner of the interface. The selected theme will be saved in your browser and automatically applied each time you visit the site, even after closing and reopening the browser.

2. Is the theme retained across all pages?
Yes, the selected theme is saved using the browser's localStorage. This means that the theme remains consistent as you navigate between pages or refresh the site. You donâ€™t need to change the theme every time.

3. How can I add new questions to the quiz?
To add new questions, follow these steps:

    1. Open the fixtures.json file in the /quiz/fixtures/ directory or use the Django admin interface to manage the database.

    2. If you prefer using Django's admin interface:

        - First, create a superuser:
        ```bash
        python manage.py createsuperuser
        ```
        - Log in to the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin using your credentials.

        - Go to the "Questions" section and add new questions by specifying the question text, options, and the correct answer.
4. How can I reset the quiz?
    To reset the quiz (i.e., start over with the questions), you can reload the page or navigate back to the homepage to start a new session.
